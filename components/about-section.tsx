                      <strong className="text-purple-300">Hi, I'm Moureen</strong> ; your behind the scenes powerhouse.
                      I'm the one you call when you're tired of juggling backend tasks, overwhelmed with marketing and
                      ready to finally scale your business with systems that work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I have a background in Sociology and Economics, but my real education came from navigating life
                      with the grit of someone constantly in survival mode. In that chapter of my life, I started
                      teaching myself digital skills out of necessity - I wanted freedom, income and a way to build
                      something bigger than just making it through the day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      That's how I discovered the world of eCommerce and I fell in love with the systems behind
                      successful online businesses. I quickly realized just how stressed and stretched most business
                      owners were trying to do it all alone. That's when it clicked ; I could be the strategic support
                      they didn't even know they needed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Today, I run a boutique digital support agency, working with global brands to simplify and scale
                      their operations. When I'm not optimizing stores or crafting email flows, I'm deep-diving into AI
                      tools, learning new ways to grow online businesses, journaling my goals or spoiling my cat, Luna.
